Add DrawLine(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1, Color color) and DrawText(string text, int x, int y, Color color) to Unity3D UnityEngine.Texture2D

=========
This additions is not for production use. Use them only for development purposes!
I know DrawText would be way faster if i would use characters atlas, but I didn't wanted extra file.
